# 2087. Insert Greatest Common Divisors in Linked List

Given a head of a linked list we can use 2 pointers to calculate the GCD to be added between them.

The real problem is calculating the GCD, if we follow the wikipedia definition the GCD is:

> The largest positive integer that divides each of the integers...

An efficient way to calculate GCD is by Euclidean algorithm a variant in which the difference of the two numbers a and b is replaced by the _remainder_ of the Euclidean division (also called _division with remainder_) of a by b.

Denoting this remainder as _a_ mod _b_, the algorithm replaces (_a_, _b_) by (_b_, _a_ mod _b_) repeatedly until the pair is (_d_, 0), where d is the greatest common divisor.

We can express this method by this code:

```java
int gcd(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0) return a; // Pair (d,0)
    return gcd(b, a%b);
}

// One Line
int gcd(int a, int b) { return b==0 ? a : gcd(b, a%b); }
```

After we calculate the GCD the game is done, we can simply use the two pointers to get the $$x_i$$ and $$x_{i+1}$$ element in the LinkedList.

```java

public ListNode insertGreatestCommonDivisors(ListNode head) {
        if (head.next == null) return head;
        
        ListNode p1 = head;
        ListNode p2 = head.next;

        while (p2 != null) {
            ListNode newNode = new ListNode(gcd(p1.val, p2.val), p2);
            p1.next = newNode;

            p1 = p2;
            p2 = p2.next;
        }

        return head;
}
```
